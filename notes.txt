file handling:
creating
reading
updating
delete

read()

open() -> base of file operations
        returns an object
        open(filename or pathofthefile)
        open(filename , mode)

mode -> read mode "r"
        open("file.txt","r")
        by default open() uses read mode if not specified
        returns error if there is no file

    -> append mode "a"
    adding the data to the existing data
    if file is not found it creates the file and append the contents to the file

    -> write mode "w"
    overiddes the data with the data provided
    previous data is removed

    -> create mode "x"
    creates an empty file
    if the file is already present it returns an error

    -> text mode "t"
    by default enabled
    used for reading text files

    -> binary mode "b"
    for reading media data , images


    read and text are by default "rt"

OS module can be used for wrong purposes by hackers too

OOPS - python
Class -> blueprint,aggregation of variables and methods
__init__
self parameter is a difference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belong to the class
self is same as this

the str controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string

inheritance and types -> single,multilevel,multiple,hybrid,hierarchial


method Overriding 

access Modifier
        -> public -
        -> private - double underscore(__) for private 
        -> protected -

overloading is a type of polymorphism that adds additional functionalities for the existing properties of objects ,methods,attributes or anything else
 -> varying datatypes of parameters
 -> varying number of arguments
 -> methods overloading in case of parameters is not supported in python


List,String,tuple,dict are iterable

iter() and next()

numpy()
for array a particular localized block is established

can be made by importin array and then making it
an array that has 0d arrays as its elements is callled unidimensional array /1-d array
1d 2d array
2d 3d array
